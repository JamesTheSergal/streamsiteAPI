### Stream site API
This repository is meant to maintain and build an API written in Python with flask.

## Install
**linuxInstalldep.sh** is a helper to quickly deploy the API to a server, or VPS.
Ensure you also have python3.10 installed, and have installed python-pip and python-virtualenv also installed
otherwise the helper script will not work.

**python3-dev default-libmysqlclient-dev build-essential** are also required.
